# Jane-Street-Market-Forecasting-Kaggle-Competition
- Built a preprocessing pipeline (median imputation, robust scaling, winsorization) for noisy, fat-tailed financial time series.
- Benchmarked models: Ridge (R²≈003), XGBoost (R²≈0.005–0.007), MLP (R²≈0.0098), showing progression from linear to nonlinear learners and importance of time-based validation.
